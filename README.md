# Glipper

> **⚠️ Alert: This app is currently not finished and is actively being worked on.**

## Introduction

Glipper is meant to help you cut game clips - mainly clips captured from the NVIDIA APP.

It doesn't (currently) do any processing to the files - it simply copies the audio & video to the shortened file.

Currently **only supports the file structure used by the nvidia software**, meaning that your clips folder should contain folders with the names of games and those folders should contain the clips.
