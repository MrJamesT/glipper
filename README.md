## Features ‚ú®

-   **Scan Your Clips Folder**: After inputting your clips folder, Glipper tries to automatically parse all your games, downloading posters and creating thumbnails for your games and clips.
-   **Quick Clip Previews**: Instantly preview any clip within the app.
-   **Simple Editing Workflow**: Select a clip, edit it and even delete it without leaving the app.
-   **Easy Clip Sharing**: You can opt in to automatically copy the cut clip into clipboard so that you can just paste it into your app of choice (Discord, Slack, Messenger...).
-   **Many more to come!**: Glipper is still being developed, more features like creating compilations from multiple clips, converting clips into different or smaller formats and others are coming!

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Alert: The app currently only expects this folder layout: [folder]/[game-name]/[clip-name].**
